My name is Max. I am a mathematician, mountain enthusiast and research engineer.

- Mathematically, I am broadly interested in geometry, dynamics, probability and their interactions,

- as a mountain enthusiast, I like to be outside with friends, mostly [mountaineering, climbing and ski-touring](https://mxstn.github.io/mountains),

- finally, as a research engineer, I am interested in python, statistics and developments in machine learning.

My current homebase is Innsbruck, Tyrol. 

I hold a MSc in mathematics from the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Subsequently, I started a PhD in mathematics at TUM ([with C. Kuehn; multiscale and stochastic dynamics](https://multiscale.systems)), which is yet to be completed. To get a glimpse of my mathematical research you can check out [my paper "the hyperbolic umbilic singularity in fast-slow systems"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6544/ad6bde).

Currently, I am research engineer at MED-EL in Innsbruck.
