my name is Maximilian Steinert.
typically, i would describe myself as a mathematician, alpinist and research engineer.

- mathematically, i am interested in geometry, dynamics, probability and their interactions.

- as an alpinist, my interests are mountaineering, climbing and ski-touring with a focus on the eastern alps.

- finally, as a research engineer, i am interested in developments in machine learning.

my current homebase is Innsbruck, Tyrol. 

i hold a BSc in mathematics from the University of Augsburg and a MSc in mathematics from the Technical University of Munich (TUM). i also started a PhD in mathematics at TUM, which is yet to be completed. currently, i am working at MED-EL.
