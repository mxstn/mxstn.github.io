personal blog of a mathematician, research engineer and alpinist.

- mathematically, i am interested in geometry, dynamics, probability and their interactions.

- as a research engineer, i am interested in developments in machine learning.

- finally, as an alpinist, my interests are mountaineering, climbing and ski-touring with a focus on the eastern alps.

my current homebase is Innsbruck, Tyrol.
