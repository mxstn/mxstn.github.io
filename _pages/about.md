my name is Maximilian Steinert.
typically i would describe myself as a mathematician, research engineer and alpinist.

- mathematically, i am interested in geometry, dynamics, probability and their interactions. i hold a BSc and MSc 

- as a research engineer, i am interested in developments in machine learning (using tools from the above three areas).

- finally, as an alpinist, my interests are mountaineering, climbing and ski-touring with a focus on the eastern alps.

my current homebase is Innsbruck, Tyrol. 

i hold a BSc in mathematics from the University of Augsburg and a MSc in mathematics from the Technical University of Munich (TUM). i also started a PhD in mathematics at TUM, which is yet to be completed ;) currently, i am working at MED-EL.
