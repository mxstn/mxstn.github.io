My name is Max.
Typically, I would describe myself as a mathematician, mountain enthusiast and research engineer.

- Mathematically,I am broadly interested in geometry, dynamics, probability and their interactions,

- as a mountain enthusiast, [my interests are mountaineering, climbing and ski-touring](https://mxstn.github.io/mountains) with a focus on the eastern alps,

- finally, as a research engineer, I am interested in developments in machine learning.

My current homebase is Innsbruck, Tyrol. 

I hold a MSc in mathematics from the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Subsequently, I started a PhD in mathematics at TUM ([with C. Kuehn; multiscale and stochastic dynamics](https://multiscale.systems)), which is yet to be completed. Currently, I am working at MED-EL.
