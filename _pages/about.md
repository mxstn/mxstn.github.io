personal blog of a mathematician, research engineer and alpinist.

mathematically, i am interested in geometry, dynamics, probability and their interactions.

as a research engineer, i am interested in machine learning methods.

finally, as an alpinist, my interests are ridge scrambling, climbing and ski-touring with a focus on the eastern alps.
